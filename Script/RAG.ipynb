It  is composed of four globular peptides, each containing a heme  complex. In the center of each heme, lies iron (Figure 11.2). Iron is  needed for the production of other iron-containing proteins such as  myoglobin. \\xa0Myoglobin is a protein found in the muscle tissues that  enhances the amount of available oxygen for muscle contraction.  Iron is also a key component of hundreds of metabolic enzymes.  Many of the proteins of the electron-transport chain contain  iron–sulfur clusters involved in the transfer of high-energy  electrons and ultimately ATP synthesis. Iron is also involved in  numerous metabolic reactions that take place mainly in the liver  and detoxify harmful substances. Moreover, iron is required for  DNA synthesis. The great majority of iron used in the body is that  recycled from the continuous breakdown of red blood cells.  Figure 11.2 The Structure of Hemoglobin  Iron  |  655'},\n",

The unpaired  electron in free radicals destabilizes them, making them highly  reactive. Other reactive oxygen species include hydrogen peroxide  and the hydroxyl radical.  Figure 8.2 Superoxide  A molecule with one unpaired electron, which makes it a free  radical.  The reactivity of free radicals is what poses a threat to  macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and fatty acids. Free  radicals can cause chain reactions that ultimately damage cells.  For example, a superoxide molecule may react with a fatty acid  and steal one of its electrons. The fatty acid then becomes a free  radical that can react with another fatty acid nearby. As this chain  reaction continues, the permeability and fluidity of cell membranes  changes, proteins in cell membranes experience decreased activity,  and receptor proteins undergo changes in structure that either alter  or stop their function. If receptor proteins designed to react to  insulin levels undergo a structural change it can negatively affect  glucose uptake.

In short, substituting vegetables and fruits in place of foods high  in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium is a good way to make  a nutrient-poor diet healthy again. Vegetables are full of nutrients  and antioxidants that help promote good health and reduce the  risk for developing chronic diseases such as stroke, heart disease,  high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.  Starting with these small shifts in your diet as mentioned above will  boost your overall health profile.  Discretionary Calories  When following a balanced, healthful diet with many nutrient-dense  foods, you may consume enough of your daily nutrients before  you reach your daily calorie limit. The remaining calories are  discretionary (to be used according to your best judgment). To find  out your discretionary calorie allowance, add up all the calories  you consumed to achieve the recommended nutrient intakes and  then subtract this number from your recommended daily caloric  allowance. For example, someone who has a recommended  2,000-calorie per day diet may eat enough nutrient-dense foods  to meet requirements after consuming only 1,814 calories. The  remaining 186 calories are discretionary. See Table 12.5 “Sample  Menu Plan Containing 2,000 Calories”.
